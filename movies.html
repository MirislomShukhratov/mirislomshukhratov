<p style="color: darkblue;font-size: 60px;">EDGE OF TOMORROW</p>

<ul>
<p style="text-align:center;">Genre:  Action | Adventure | Sci-Fi  </p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Release date: 5 Juni 2014</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Stars: Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt, Bill Paxton</p>
<li>Description:
Edge of Tomorrow is described by the director himself as "Groundhog Day meets Starship Troopers". The former mentioned is actually quite important since the trailers made this film look pretty dark, which is not the case. This is fun action film with lots of humor. Humor that perfectly fits this film. The time-loop allows the Cruise's Colonel Cage to remember exactly the situation he repeats over and over, which is many times very funny. At films with time-loop I am alway worried that the film might get repetitive. Well you don't have to when Doug Liman is at helm. The film has no time to get repetitive when it is moving at such fast pace. An action scene follows an actions and the scope is just mind blowing. This film packs in so much in just two hours. Other films usually keep the best scenes for the big finale. In Edge of Tomorrow all the action scenes are the best scenes of the film.</li>
